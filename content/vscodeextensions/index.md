Following is list of very useful VS Code extensions which you should consider trying out. Most are self explanatory and a quick lookup in VS Code extensions will do the job for you. However, we are giving a one-liner for each to help you choose the right tool for you and to get started quickly.Will keep this list updated if we happen to stumble upon a extension which we really find useful and use on almost daily basis. 

- **GitLens** - quickly lookup commit history and quicker way to work with git.
- **Pieces** - Your Personal Micro Repo for code snippets
- **Better Comments** - Add custom tags to your comments and add custom styling to help your comments stand out
- **Turbo Console Log** - quickly add console log statements and use keyboard shortcuts to comment / uncomment / delete log statements
- **Code Runner** - quickly run a piece of code. very useful when you are refractoring
- **Import Cost** - worried about import bundle. Quickly see import size and adopt best practices.
= **Prettier** - In our opinion a must have and most popular plugin to work with VS Code
- **REST Client** - why open Postman in a seperate window when you can do all that from within VS code.
- **Live Server** - need of a quick simple web server?? look no further
- **ESLint** - for Linting
- **Docker** - working with Docker images and containers this is the extension you need to
- **Material Theme** - a nice to have theme
- **Indent Rainbow** - a must for python devs when they forget number of indents or tab presses they have done on a line
- **CodeSnap** - take beautiful screenshot of your app
- **Code Time** - programming metrics right inside VS code.


Kindly note VS code is a general purpose editor and by using extensions you can turn the editor into an IDE for the technologies you want to work on. In simple terms, say you are working on python then install *Python* related extensions. Working on java, you can install *Extension Pack for Java*. working on mobile development using Flutter?? dont forget to install **Flutter Widget Snippets**. I think you get the picture.

Thanks for reading and be sure to visit us on our Twitter handle and let us know if we are missing on an awesome extension that is out there in the wild.
