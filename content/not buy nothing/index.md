Nothing Phone (1) is the biggest launch of the year in the smartphone space. A radical reinterpretation of mobile tech? Yes it promises to bring some new things to the table and is incarnation of mobile phone designed from scratch. But the real question is - should i buy the phone. Our short answer is No. No if you are a budget consumer and want best bang for your buck. Dont get us wrong. we are impressed with the product and love the tech. Our only major apprehension is that it is the first iteration of the phone and it misses on some of the aspects which we expect to improve over time. We go as far as to say that second or third iteration placed at a competitive price can place the company at a sweet spot in already very competitive mobile market.

**Our reasons, why we think this phone lies in 'Do Not Buy' category at the moment**
- No in-box accessories (Not even the Charger)
- Low Overall value for money
- Low Display Brightness
- Quality controll issues
- No 3.5mm Audio Jack
- Has decent processor for balanced use, but dont expect too much
- Very poor after-sales presence, expected as it is first iteration of the phone
- Beautiful phone design is not complemented by its OS properly. Nothing OS is very limited at the moment.


**To summarize**, buy if you have money to spare and want to look trendy and if thats your definition of being cool. But if you want bang for the buck, we would recommend to wait for the second or third iteration of the phone and re-evaluate its specs and performance against the reasons mentioned above and then take your call.
