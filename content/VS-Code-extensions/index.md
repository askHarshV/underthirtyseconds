Following is list of very useful VS Code extensions which you should consider trying out. Most are self explanatory and a quick lookup in VS Code extensions will do the job for you. However, we are giving a one-liner for each to help you choose the right tool for you and to get started quickly.Will keep this list updated if we happen to stumble upon a extension which we really find useful and use on almost daily basis. 

- **GitLens** - quickly lookup commit history and quicker way to work with git.
- **Pieces** - Your Personal Micro Repo for code snippets
- **Better Comments** - Add custom tags to your comments and add custom styling to help your comments stand out
- **Turbo Console Log** - quickly add console log statements and use keyboard shortcuts to comment / uncomment / delete log statements
- **Code Runner** - quickly run a piece of code. very useful when you are refractoring
- **Import Cost** - worried about import bundle. Quickly see import size and adopt best practices.
= **Prettier** - In our opinion a must have and most popular plugin to work with VS Code
- **REST Client** - why open Postman in a seperate window when you can do all that from within VS code.
- **Live Server** - need of a quick simple web server?? look no further
- **ESLint** - for Linting
- **Docker** - working with Docker images and containers this is the extension you need to
